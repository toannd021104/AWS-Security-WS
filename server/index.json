	"content": "Security Hub automatically collects and consolidates findings from AWS security services enabled in your environment, such as intrusion detection findings from Amazon GuardDuty, vulnerability scans from Amazon Inspector, Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) bucket policy findings from Amazon Macie, publicly accessible and cross-account resources from IAM Access Analyzer, and resources lacking WAF coverage from AWS Firewall Manager.\nThis aggregation provides a view of security and compliance across your AWS environment. AWS Security Hub aggregates security findings from dozens of AWS security services and APN products in a single place and format, the AWS Security Finding Format (ASFF). Security Hub doesn\u0026rsquo;t retroactively detect and consolidate security findings that were generated before you enabled Security Hub. All findings are stored in Security Hub for 90 days after last update date.\nThe Integrations page in the AWS Management Console provides access to all of the available AWS and third-party product integrations. The AWS Security Hub API also provides operations to allow you to manage integrations. For AWS services, Security Hub automatically enables the integration, and you can optionally disable each integration.\nCentralizing findings from AWS security services Security Hub brings together findings from all your AWS security services—like GuardDuty, Inspector, Macie, Access Analyzer, and Firewall Manager—so you get a complete view of your security and compliance. Findings are stored for 90 days and shown in a unified format.\nCentralizing findings from AWS security services  Go to Security Hub and open the Summary page for an overview of your account’s security status. Review the insights to find common threat types. These are aggregated from services like GuardDuty. Open the Integrations page to see all available integrations. Many, like GuardDuty and Inspector, are enabled automatically, but you need to turn on each service to generate findings. You can enable or disable integrations as needed. Try disabling the Firewall Manager integration, but click Cancel to keep it active. To see findings from a specific service, click See findings for that integration. This adds a filter so you only see those findings. Adjust filters to change the list of findings you’re viewing.  Searching and reviewing security findings  To see all findings, remove filters and Group By options at the top of the page.\n  Try adding a filter for high severity findings from GuardDuty.\n  From the dropdown, select Severity label and choose is and then input HIGH. This is case-sensitive. Click Apply. Result: Choose one finding to see more information   Click Add filters in the search bar again. This time, select Product name and choose is and then input GuardDuty. Click Apply.\n  Pick one of the findings and click on the title. This opens the finding details pane. Expand all the sections and take a few minutes to review the information here. You can see the description, a link to remediation instructions, information about the resource, and more.\n  In the finding details pane click the finding ID link at the top of the pane to display the complete JSON for the finding. Security Hub processes findings using a standard findings format called the AWS Security Finding Format (ASFF), which eliminates the need for time-consuming data conversion efforts. The finding JSON can be downloaded to a file if ever needed for further investigation.   Close out of the JSON pop-up by clicking the X in the top right.\n  At the top of the finding details, open the History tab to view a chronological list of all changes that have been made to the finding. The transparency of finding history helps you identify potential security risks more quickly and take proactive steps to mitigate them.\n  Close the finding details pane by clicking the X in the top right, but stay on the findings page.\n  Let\u0026rsquo;s try to understand what resources in our environment are generating the most findings. Remove all the filters. Then add a new filter, select Resource type and choose is not and then input AwsAccount. Click Apply. Result:   Add another filter. Select Record state, choose is, and then input ACTIVE. Click Apply.   Click Add filters in the search bar again. This time, select Group by and choose ResourceId. Click Apply. This list shows you the number of security findings per resource. This can help you prioritize work by the resources in your environment with the most security issues. Result:   Generating insights from aggregated findings  If you find the list of number of security findings per resource beneficial, you can save it as a custom Insight for future reference. Click Create insight in the top right of the screen.\n  Name the insight \u0026ldquo;0. Resources by counts of findings\u0026rdquo;. Then click Create insight.   In the navigation on the left, click Insights. A Security Hub Insight is a collection of related findings defined by an aggregation statement and optional filters. An insight identifies a security area that requires attention and intervention. Security Hub offers several managed (default) insights that you can\u0026rsquo;t modify or delete. You can also create custom insights to track security issues unique to your AWS environment and usage.\n  The first Insight listed is the one you just created. Click on the title 0. Resources by counts of findings. Here you have the same view as before plus generated graphs. We\u0026rsquo;ll dive deeper into Insights later.   Return to the Insights page using the navigation on the left.\n  Take a few minutes to review the other AWS-provided Insights. Filter for insight severity.\n  Click on 24.

Detective builds a linked set of data so you can easily explore and investigate suspicious activities. It keeps up to a year of data and provides visualizations to show changes in activity and link them to security findings.\nAmazon Detective simplifies the investigative process and helps security teams conduct faster and more effective investigations. Amazon Detective’s prebuilt data aggregations, summaries, and context help you to quickly analyze and determine the nature and extent of possible security issues. Amazon Detective maintains up to a year of aggregated data and makes it easily available through a set of visualizations that shows changes in the type and volume of activity over a selected time window, and links those changes to security findings. There are no upfront costs and you pay only for the events analyzed, with no additional software to deploy or log feeds to enable.\nAmazon Detective extracts time-based events such as login attempts, API calls, and network traffic from AWS CloudTrail, Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) Flow Logs, Amazon GuardDuty findings, AWS Security Hub findings, and Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS) audit logs. Detective creates a behavior graph that utilizes machine learning (ML) to create a unified, interactive view of your resource behaviors and their interactions over time, specifically for these time-based events. By exploring the behavior graph, you can analyze security events such as failed login attempts, suspicious APIs call, or finding groups to help you in investigating the root cause of your AWS Security Findings.\nThreat actors often perform a series of actions when attempting to compromise your AWS environment, which can result in multiple security findings across your AWS resources. Finding groups are collections of security findings and resources that are associated with a single potential security incident you should investigate together. Finding groups can help reduce triage time because you don’t have to investigate each individual security finding separately. You can start your investigation with finding groups, which offer a more complete understanding of the incident. It also offers interactive visualizations that allows you to explore specific findings and insights using generative AI to describe the chain of events in natural language.\n"

	"content": "Security Hub - Overview Security Standards  Start by heading to the AWS Security Hub summary page. This is your main dashboard for security insights. On the Summary page, you\u0026rsquo;ll easily spot which standards are active in your account. You’ll also see how many controls have passed or failed for each standard, and a handy percentage showing your overall compliance status. To explore further, click on Security standards in the left navigation menu. Good news: the standards were already enabled for you using CloudFormation when the workshop was set up! Let’s take a closer look at a specific standard. Click View Results for NIST Special Publication 800-53 Revision 5 to see more details.  Controls At the top, you can switch between tabs to view only \u0026ldquo;Passed\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;Failed\u0026rdquo;, or \u0026ldquo;Disabled\u0026rdquo; controls. You can also use the search bar to filter controls by ID. Try searching for ID = EC2.13. Click on the control titled \u0026ldquo;Security groups should not allow ingress from 0.0.0.0/0 to port 22.\u0026rdquo; This will show you all resources checked for this control and their current status—some may have FAILED, others PASSED. For every check, AWS Security Hub provides helpful remediation instructions. Click the Remediation instructions link at the top to open guidance in a new tab.  Investigating a misconfigured resource  Return to the Security Hub control you were looking at. For one of the FAILED resources open Config rule in the Investigate column. This will display links that will take you to AWS Config to view the configuration timeline for this resource or the overall config rule that performed the evaluation on this resource.   Click Configuration timeline. This opens AWS Config, and shows the resource configuration timeline for this security group. From here, you can investigate the point in time when the resource became non-compliant by reviewing the timestamped events. If you want, take a minute to expand a couple of the events.   Expand a CloudTrail Event listed.   Then click CloudTrail under View event. This opens up that event, logged in CloudTrail. AWS CloudTrail monitors and records account activity across your AWS infrastructure, giving you control over storage, analysis, and remediation actions.   Consolidated controls  Return to Security Hub and open General settings page from the navigation panel. https://console.aws.amazon.com/securityhub/home?#/settings/general   At the top of the page, you should see that both \u0026ldquo;Auto-enable new controls in enabled standards\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Consolidated control findings\u0026rdquo; is enabled.\n  Click Controls from the navigation panel. This page shows a similar view to what you reviewed at the standard level, but here you see the full list of consolidated controls. This makes it easier to see how many individual controls in your account are passing, failing, or in some other state. Additionally, with consolidated findings enabled, controls included in multiple enabled standards no longer generate a finding per standard (duplicates). This helps manage the number of findings in your environment and removes potential confusion around duplicate findings.\n  Insights In the navigation on the left, click Insights.  In the search bar, input \u0026ldquo;severity\u0026rdquo; and select the insight named 24. Severity by counts of findings.  Security Hub offers several built-in managed insights. You cannot modify or delete managed insights. 24. Severity by counts of findings is one of the managed insights. Take a minute to review the number of findings in the environment.

	"tags": [],
	"description": "",
	"content": "Detective - Finding Groups Detective finding groups help you analyze multiple related activities for a potential security event. Instead of investigating each finding separately, you can look at the whole group to understand the incident better. Detective uses graph analysis to link findings and entities, making investigations faster and more complete.\nYou can analyze the root cause for high severity GuardDuty findings using finding groups. If a threat actor is attempting to compromise your AWS environment, they typically perform a sequence of actions that lead to multiple security findings and unusual behaviors. These actions are often spread across time and entities. When security findings are investigated in isolation, it can lead to a misinterpretation of their significance, and difficulty in finding the root cause. Amazon Detective addresses this problem by applying a graph analysis technique that infers relationships between findings and entities, and groups them together. We recommend treating finding groups as the starting point for investigating the involved entities and findings.\nDetective analyzes data from findings and groups them with other findings that are likely to be related based on resources they share. For example, findings related to actions taken by the same IAM role sessions or originating from the same IP address are very likely to be part of the same underlying activity. It\u0026rsquo;s valuable to investigate findings and evidence as a group, even if the associations made by Detective aren\u0026rsquo;t related.\nIn addition to findings, each group includes entities involved in the findings. The entities can include resources outside of AWS such as IP Addresses or user agents.\nAfter an initial GuardDuty finding occurs that is related to another finding, the finding group with all related findings and all involved entities is created within 48 hours.\n"
