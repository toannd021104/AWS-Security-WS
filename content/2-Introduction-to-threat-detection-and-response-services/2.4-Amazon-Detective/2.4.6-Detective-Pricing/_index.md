## Detective - Pricing

1. Detective shows how many days are left in your free trial and your average daily cost.
2. Open the Usage page under Settings to review your usage and estimated cost. The estimates displayed in the GuardDuty console may differ slightly than those in your AWS Billing and Cost Management console. For more information, see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/guardduty/latest/ug/monitoring_costs.html.
