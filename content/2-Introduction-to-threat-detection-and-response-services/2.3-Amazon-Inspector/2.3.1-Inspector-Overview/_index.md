## Inspector - Overview

Amazon Inspector is your AWS vulnerability scanner! It automatically checks your workloads for software vulnerabilities and network exposure. Once enabled, Inspector discovers EC2 instances, container images, and Lambda functions, then starts scanning for known issues. Inspector gives each finding a risk score to help you prioritize fixes. All findings are shown in the Inspector console and sent to Security Hub and EventBridge for automation. Container image findings are also sent to ECR for easy remediation.
