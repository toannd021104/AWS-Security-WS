## Aggregating findings from multiple AWS accounts

Using Security Hub with AWS Organizations lets you enable Security Hub for all accounts, including new ones. This gives you a centralized view of security across accounts and regions. Use the delegated administrator feature for central management.

**Note to readers**: Although the workshop says "At this time, we are unable to demonstrate multi-account aggregation in this workshop". However, in the **Automated Security Response on AWS** section, the architecture diagram shows that the Cloudformation stacks have been deployed in multiple AWS accounts.
