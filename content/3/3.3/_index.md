## Centralizing findings from AWS partner solutions

Security Hub can also collect findings from AWS Partner Network solutions and your own custom security products. Only findings generated after enabling Security Hub are collected.

1. In Security Hub, search for Cloud Custodian in the Integrations page.
2. Click Accept Findings and review the permissions.
3. Click Accept findings to allow the partner solution to send findings. Cloud Custodian is already set up to send findings for this workshop. For other integrations, complete the Configure step in the partner solution.
4. Click See findings to view new findings from Cloud Custodian. It may take a few minutes for them to appear.
